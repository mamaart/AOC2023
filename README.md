# Advent of Code 2023

I am trying to solve advent of code this year only with Haskell

## Day1

We are calibrating a trebuchet to shoot the main character to where the snow comes from. (Snow Island)

### Part 1

Problem is we need to find first and last number in each line

```
1abc2
pqr3stu8vwx
a1b2c3d4e5f
treb7uchet
```

### Part2

Now we need to consider written letters as well

```
two1nine
eightwothree
abcone2threexyz
xtwone3four
4nineeightseven2
zoneight234
7pqrstsixteen
```

## Day2

Playing a game with an elf with cubes in differen colors.

```
Game 1: 3 blue, 4 red; 1 red, 2 green, 6 blue; 2 green
Game 2: 1 blue, 2 green; 3 green, 4 blue, 1 red; 1 green, 1 blue
Game 3: 8 green, 6 blue, 20 red; 5 blue, 4 red, 13 green; 5 green, 1 red
Game 4: 1 green, 3 red, 6 blue; 3 green, 6 red; 3 green, 15 blue, 14 red
Game 5: 6 red, 1 blue, 3 green; 2 blue, 1 red, 2 green
```

### Part1

What is the sum of possible games if the bag only has 12 red, 13 green and 14 blue cubes

### Part2

What is the fewest number of cubes of each color that could have been in the bag to make the game possible.

# ðŸŽ… Advent of Code 2023

I am trying to solve advent of code this year only with [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/) - mostly using [parsec](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/parsec) for parsing the assignment input.

My goals on top of just solving the assignements are:

- to make a readable and consise solution 
- with as few lines as possible
- and no external dependencies except parsec.
